# Repo Visibility Decision (Initial Recommendation)

## Recommendation
Start **public now**, but publish a **minimal concept-first repo**.

## Why public now
- Creates public timestamp and provenance
- Attracts early feedback/collaboration
- Clarifies positioning before ecosystem converges

## What to publish now
- README (positioning + differentiators)
- architecture and roadmap docs
- non-sensitive policy examples/checklists
- citation metadata

## What to hold back initially
- any credentials/secrets/internal infra details
- unstable/private datasets
- noisy intermediate artifacts

## Alternative
If you need 1–2 weeks to clean narrative/licensing, keep private temporarily and set a date to flip public.
