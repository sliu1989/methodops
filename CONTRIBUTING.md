Thanks for your interest in MethodOps.

## Principles
- Preserve human governance (no bypass of approval gates)
- Keep policy explicit and auditable
- Prefer reproducibility over speed hacks

## Workflow
1. Open issue describing proposed change
2. Link change to a stage (`planning_codegen`, `execution_interpretation`, etc.)
3. Include tests or validation notes
4. Document any policy impact in corresponding `SKILL.md`

## Pull requests
- Keep PRs scoped
- Include before/after behavior
- Include risk notes for governance and reproducibility
