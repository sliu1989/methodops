- Human gates in notebooks
- Artifact manifests and prompt snapshots

## v0.2: Policy-as-code
- ADEMP validator package
- Gate failure diagnostics and remediation hints
- Structured schema contracts for LLM outputs

## v0.3: Orchestration + reproducibility
- CLI/runner for stage orchestration
- Reproducible environment + seed/version pinning
- Regression tests for portability

## v0.4: Evaluation framework
- Compare autonomy-first vs governed workflows
- Metrics: validity, reproducibility, interpretability, failure rate, review burden

## v1.0: Research-ready release
- Stable templates
- Documentation for adoption
- Example benchmark projects
